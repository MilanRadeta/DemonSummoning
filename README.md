# Demon Summoning - Unity Card Game

Demon Summoning is a video game being made in Unity based on the card game Let's Summon Demons made by Steven Rhodes and Cryptozoic Entertainment.

I'm developing it myself, alone, for educational purposes, in order to improve my skills in game development and as a fan tribute to Steven Rhodes games.

The video game is not for commercial use, does not use any of copyrighted artwork and uses graphics that I've generated myself.
